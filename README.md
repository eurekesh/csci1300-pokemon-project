# csci1300-pokemon-project
This repo contains the code for the final project of CSCI 1300: Starting Computing for Fall 2019. Working implementation is in the `working` directory and should run fine when compiled with the `-std=c++11` flag.  
Additionally, the project has some visualization files that are compatible with Sourcetrail merely for amusement.  
Code is not guaranteed to be efficient, but it worked for a beginner project.  

Game
------------------
The game runs within the command line, offering a map with randomized Pokemon placement complete with battles, random encounters, health, gyms, and pokemon centers. The menus should guide you through startup! The pokemon list is fully customizeable, just make sure to restart the game if you make any changes to `pokemon.txt`. Furthermore, the map is customizeable as well. You win the game by either collecting 6 gym badges or collecting 8 types of pokemon.
